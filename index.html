      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <h2>Time in the Military</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Kevin, and I'm a recent Navy Veteran.  I spent 8 years there, where I was working as a cook.  I prefered to work in an IT position, but I couldn't because of undermanning issues.  
      </p>
      <h2>Home Life</h2>
      <p>  
        I was born in Brooklyn New York, but live in the Atlanta area at the moment.  I live here with my 3 German Shepherds, who mean everything to me.  
      </p>
      <h2>Schooling</h2>  
      <p>
        I am currently enrolled into Code Fellows because I read that it was a great school to attend, and I wanted to fast track my way into my new career.  I am also enrolled in college, which is where I was taking classes before here.  
      </p>  
      <h2>Current Work</h2>  
      <p>
        As for work, I currently work for Best Buy because of my love for technology.  I'm only in the warehouse section of Best Buy, but if I decide to work as a web developer, Best Buy is the first place I will look for employment.  
      </p>  
      <h2>Future Goals</h2>  
      <p>
        My goals are to work as a Software engineer as soon as I am done with my courses here, hopefully working as an ethical hacker, or working on some kind of OS, preferably either Windows or Android.
